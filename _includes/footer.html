Here at the Illinois Institute of Technology, IEEE represents one of the largest student organizations on campus.

Our organization strives to further students' professional and educational development through a wide array of opportunities. Please take a look at what we have to offer, and come visit the IEEE Office located in Siegel Hall 013! </b>
